  <p>a Few years ago I set out on a journey of self discovery. I am a 37 year old female born in Limpopo, South Africa, and I am learning how to code.</p>
  <p>I do not have a formal tersiary education, I am self taught. I've dabbled in Video Editing, Graphic Design and Photography among other things, but I've always felt that there was something missing. That there's more potential out there, answers to seek, problems to find and a world of possibilities to explore.</p>
